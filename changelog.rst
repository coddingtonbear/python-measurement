1.8.0 (11 November 2015)
------------------------

* Changes names of a few measures and measurements to their correct
  scientific or SI names (thanks @yggdr!):
  * `measures.Weight` is now `measures.Mass`; note that
    `measures.Weight` has been preserved as an alias of `measures.mass`
    for backward-compatibility.
  * The base unit of `measures.Time` is now `s` instead of `sec`.  The
    measure unit `sec` has been preserved as an alias of `s` for
    backward compatibility.
